    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from the Sichuan province. It is a spicy and aromatic dish 
        made with tofu, minced meat (usually pork or beef), fermented black beans, and chili paste. 
        It is known for its unique combination of flavors, including the numbing sensation of Sichuan 
        peppercorns and the heat from chili peppers. Mapo Tofu is often served with steamed rice and
