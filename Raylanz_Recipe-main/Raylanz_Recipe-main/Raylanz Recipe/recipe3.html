        <h1>Peking Roast Duck</h1>
        <img src="css/3.jpg" alt="Peking Roast Duck">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Created for the Ming Dynasty, Peking roast duck has since become a common delicacy enjoyed in
            Beijing, China. Seasoned before being oven-roasted, Peking duck is often served right out of
            the oven with its signature crisp and golden-brazed skin still intact. Served with the duck, 
            bringing the dish together, is sides of spring onion, cucumber, and sweet bean sauce.</p>
